# http-web-server
Creating a http web server using raw sockets and C language.

This server can:
- Accept browser connections
- Read HTTP requests
- Serve an HTML file from disk
- Return '404 Not Found' for unknown pages
- Handle multiple clients as the same time

I used:
- C language
- TCP sockets
- HTTP protocols
- File I/O
- Fork( to handle multiple requests)


Thank you...
